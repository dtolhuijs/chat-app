------------------

Simplified version of [react-Chat-App](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate) for the
traineeship program.

## Skills learned 
  - I learned how to build a chat app with react.js and how to get my messages stored using mongoose.
  - I learned how to use components (classes extending React.Component) within react.js to build organized and easy to maintain code.
  - Connecting the front-end part to the back-end (node.js server) was probably the most important lesson out of this because it gave a better understanding of the whole cycle of data.
